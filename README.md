## Minimizing Empty Truck Miles Driven via Decision-Theoretic Online Learning and Link Prediction on a Temporal Transportation Graph 

Reducing the total miles driven by unloaded trucks is a critical challenge in the transportation
industry with significant economic and environmental implications. This paper frames the issue
as a statistical decision problem in an online setting, where a driver who has just completed a
delivery must decide whether to wait at the current location for a new order or return to the
starting point.

The study presents a link prediction algorithm applied to a time-varying transportation demand
graph, utilizing Temporal Random Walks within the Node2Vec embedding framework. Then, it
assesses the performance of the Hedge Algorithm based on predicted probabilities of new edges
to neighboring nodes generated by both the proposed prediction algorithm and traditional static
graph link prediction algorithms. The study demonstrates the proposed algorithmâ€™s advantage by
achieving sublinear regret.
